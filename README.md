## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I wasn't sure how I was going to make the two images they gave me for the background (the circles) work. So I approached it with absolute positioning, but that didn't work since it would overflow the page, especially on mobile. 

I learned that fixed positioning worked very well for this!
